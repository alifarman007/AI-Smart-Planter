# Smart Indoor Planter
 
Welcome to the Smart Indoor Planter project! ðŸŒ±ðŸ’¡
 
## Introduction
 
The Smart Indoor Planter is a revolutionary gardening solution that enables you to grow plants indoors without sunlight or soil. This project combines advanced technology, including embedded coding and artificial intelligence, to create the ultimate gardening experience right in your own home.
 
## Features
 
- **Sunlight Simulation:** Utilizes advanced LED lighting technology to simulate sunlight, providing the perfect environment for plant growth.
- **Soilless Growing:** Eliminates the need for traditional soil, allowing plants to thrive in a soilless medium.
- **Customizable Light Intensity:** Integrated OLED Arduino display allows for easy customization of light intensity to suit the needs of different plants.
- **Menu Selection:** User-friendly menu interface enables users to select the type of plant being grown, automatically adjusting light settings accordingly.
- **AI-Powered Optimization:** Machine learning algorithms analyze plant responses to light intensity, continuously optimizing settings for maximum growth potential.
- **Dual Pot System:** Features two separate pots, allowing for simultaneous cultivation of different plants or varieties.
- **Versatile Plant Options:** Capable of growing a wide range of plants, from small herbs to fruits, and even cannabis.
 
## Getting Started
 
To get started with your own Smart Indoor Planter, follow these steps:
 
1. **Hardware Setup:** Assemble the Smart Indoor Planter hardware components according to the provided instructions.
2. **Embedded Coding:** Upload the embedded code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE, ensuring proper functionality of the OLED display and light intensity control.
3. **Plant Selection:** Use the menu interface to select the type of plant being grown in each pot.
4. **Watering:** Provide water to the plants as needed, and watch them thrive in their soilless environment.
